# F4India24Python
 All the data and scripts from Formula 4 India 2024 analysis

F4 project - 
Looking at your cornering_3_DRVS.py script, i had an idea to plot the same graph for the F4 races that are happening.
I was successfully able to do that using RaceStudio3 data exports that i was able to gather while in the pits, since the GPS data from there looks much cleaner and with little to no inconsistecies.
I have built in the same functionalities that your script has, and have added the functionality to add 2 different driver's data so that we can compare their fastest lap instantly.
i have made a separate repo for that. you can find the link below.
