prompt for fastest lap logic from RS3 data = the way you are isolating the fastest lap telemetry data is completely wrong
to calculate the starting time stamp of the fastest lap in the time col, take the sum of all the segment times from the start till the one segment time just before it. 
to calculate the ending time stamp of the fastest lap in the time col, just take the sum of all the segment times from the start till the fastest lap time including.
now cut the telemetry data using the before timestamps and save it in telemetry_FL dataframe for both the drivers data
